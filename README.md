## Welcome to our MMO-Spiel Project  

**What are MMO games?**  
A massively multiplayer online game (MMOG, or more commonly, MMO) is an online game with large numbers of players, typically from hundreds to thousands, on the same server. ... They include a variety of gameplay types, representing many video game genres.

**Our job** is create a simple framework for MMO games so that the developer can link this framework to the MMO game he has programmed.  

**Our Dokumentation:** [Dokumenation-MMO-Framework](https://thm-mni-ii.github.io/SWTP_WS19-20_framework/)   
**Our Wiki:** [Wiki-MMO-Framework](https://github.com/thm-mni-ii/SWTP_WS19-20_framework/wiki)  
You  can start the game directly from releases
